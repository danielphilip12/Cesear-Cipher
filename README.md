# Cesear-Cipher
A program that emulates the Cesear Cipher
This program is a Cesear Cipher
The Cesear Cipher is an encryption tool.
It works by taking a letter, then moving some number
to a new letter (e.g. A + 3 = D, X + 5 = C)
The way this program works is by adding the key to the 
index location of a letter in the alphabet and taking the % 26 inorder to keep it from 
exceeding the index
